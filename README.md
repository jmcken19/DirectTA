# TA-Direct

**Bridging the Essential Gap Between Students, Professors, and Teaching Assistants.**

In modern higher education, communication bottlenecks choke academic success. Students struggle to reach TAs, professors are overwhelmed with repetitive administrative questions, and Teaching Assistants lack a centralized, secure platform to manage their sections effectively.

## The Mission

To empower Teaching Assistants as the academic frontline, ensuring no student query goes unanswered while fundamentally protecting the TA's time and privacy.

We believe that university communication should not rely on disjointed email threads, scattered Canvas announcements, or unmanaged Discord servers. TA-Direct provides a curated portal that creates a seamless, stress-free conduit between the student's need for help and the TA's ability to provide it.
