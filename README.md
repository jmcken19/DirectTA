# TA-Direct

**Bridging the Essential Gap Between Students, Professors, and Teaching Assistants.**

In modern higher education, communication bottlenecks choke academic success. Students struggle to reach TAs, professors are overwhelmed with repetitive administrative questions, and Teaching Assistants lack a centralized, secure platform to manage their sections effectively. 

**TA-Direct** is the solution: a premium, high-contrast, fully modular communication portal designed exclusively for the academic triage process.

## 🚀 The Mission

**To empower Teaching Assistants as the academic frontline, ensuring no student query goes unanswered while fundamentally protecting the TA's time and privacy.**

We believe that university communication shouldn't rely on disjointed email threads, scattered Canvas announcements, or unmanaged Discord servers. TA-Direct provides a curated "Bento Box" portal that creates a seamless, stress-free conduit between the student's need for help and the TA's ability to provide it.

### Core Pillars
1. **The Institutional Gateway**: A secure, school-authenticated nexus that guarantees interactions remain within the academic ecosystem ("C CHARLOTTE").
2. **The Selection Hub**: A streamlined directory allowing students to instantly locate and access their specific TA's portal.
3. **The Bento Portal**: A modular, customizable interface for TAs to centralize their links, office hours, and Live Chat.
4. **The Logic Engine**: An administration powerhouse giving TAs granular control over their availability, visual presence (Aura), and an AI-driven FAQ moderation queue that learns from repetitive questions.
